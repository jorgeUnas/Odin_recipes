        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The best burger recipe for summertime grilling! This juicy burger is jam-packed with all kinds of stuff and has no tasteless bread crumbs. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef: These basic burgers start with 1 ½ pounds of lean ground beef. </li>
            <li>Onion: A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
            <li>Cheese: You’ll need shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese. </li>
            <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and helps bind the patties together.</li>
            <li>Bread: Select a good brand</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
            <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
